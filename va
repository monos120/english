VIENNESE ACTIONISM: POSTMODERN ART ISN'T THAT BAD
What is art? Why do we create and consume it? Should it have a specific purpose, and if so, what should that purpose be? How do we separate good art from bad art?These are all questions that rose to prominence in the art community during twentieth century, and since then, people significantly smarter than I am have written about, discussed, debated, agonised over them for decades. Yet many still feel they have no satisfactory answer. The contemporary art that posed these questions initially, and that which is derived from it, is largely mocked and derided as meaningless drivel- just look at any YouTube comments section on the subject. And whilst generally, I don't entirely disagree, there's one criticism of current art that I find baffling. 
"Pretentious".
In this essay, I will illustrate why I think that postmodern art is far more accessible to the general public than critics believe. Specifically, I will use the example of Viennese Actionism, which demonstrates common themes of postmodern art, but as postmodernism is a negatively defined reactionary art movement, I can't account for every aspect.
Viennese Actionism was an informal, avant-garde art movement that occurred in Austria from 1960 to 1971. It was made up primarily of four members; Günter Brus, Rudolf Schwarzkogler, Hermann Nitsch and Otto Mühl, who partook in performances- referred to as “aktions”- which were short, violent, and occasionally illegal. Actionists often used organic materials in place of paint, such as blood, urine, faeces, and animal organs, and “painted” human bodies rather than canvases. They are considered some of the most extreme performances artists of the 20th century, if not of all time.
It is important to understand the environment from which Actionism was conceived to fully appreciate what the artists were doing. At the beginning of the 1960s, Vienna was still recovering from two world wars and Soviet occupation, which had lasted for ten years. There is little English documentation of conditions during this era, but when the Austrian government reformed in 1955, they were regarded by the artists as authoritative and controlling, a fascist state. Their art was intended to challenge conformity, conventional art, and the perceived perception of suppression of the trauma caused by World War II.
The earliest Actionist piece was a painting, Untitled, by Brus, which was their first exploration into the use of organic material as a medium.

The bodily mutilation often present in the Actionists’ art could be seen as a reclamation of the pain they experienced and witnessed during the war.
