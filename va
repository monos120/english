>“What is art?” In this west, for a long time this question had a fairly simple answer: art was whatever the church deemed art. [[]]
>The most famous example of early “anti-art” is “Fountain” by the influential artist Marcel Duchamp, 1917, which was nothing but a urinal with the pseudonym “R. Mutt” scrawled near the bottom. It was submitted as a joke to an exhibition to mock its loose rules and modern art, but the outrage it provoked ended up posing [[]] 
Viennese Actionism was an informal, avant-garde art movement that occurred in Austria from 1960 to 1971. It was made up primarily of four members; Günter Brus, Rudolf Schwarzkogler, Hermann Nitsch and Otto Mühl, who partook in performances- referred to as “aktions”- which were short, violent, and occasionally illegal. Actionists often used organic materials in place of paint, such as blood, urine, faeces, and animal organs, and “painted” human bodies rather than canvases. They are considered some of the most extreme performances artists of the 20th century, if not of all time.
It is important to understand the environment from which Actionism was conceived to fully appreciate what the artists were doing. At the beginning of the 60s, Vienna was still recovering from two world wars and Soviet occupation, which had lasted for ten years. There is little English documentation of conditions during this era, but when the Austrian government reformed in 1955, they were regarded by the artists as authoritative and controlling, a fascist state. Their art was intended to challenge conformity, conventional art, and the perceived perception of suppression of the trauma caused by World War II.
[The bodily mutilation often present in the Actionists’ art could be seen as a reclamation of the pain they experienced and witnessed during the war.]
The earliest Actionist piece was a painting, Untitled, by Brus, which was their first exploration into the use of organic material as a medium. The second, another untitled painting, was the first time the nature of the canvas itself was questioned, as Brus tore it apart, smeared it with dirt, and covered it in sand and human faeces. In 1965, Brus 
>While the nature and content of each artist's work differed, there are distinct aesthetic and thematic threads connecting the Actions of Brus, Mühl, Nitsch, and Schwarzkogler. Use of the body as both surface and site of art-making seems to have been a common point of origin for the Actionists in their earliest departures from conventional art practices in the late '50s and early '60s. Brus' "Hand Painting Head Painting" action of 1964, Mühl and Nitsch's "Degradation of a Female Body, Degradation of A Venus" of 1963 are characterized by their efforts to reconceive human bodies as surfaces for the production of art. The trajectories of the Actionists' work suggests more than just a precedent to later performance art and body art, rather, a drive toward a totalizing art-practice is inherent in their refusing to be confined within conventional ideas of painting, theatre and sculpture.
