UNFINISHED INFORMATIVE ESSAY VERY ROUGH DRAFT
What is art? Why do we create and consume it? Should it have a specific purpose, and if so, what should that purpose be? How do we separate good art from bad art?These are all questions that rose to prominence in the art community during twentieth century, and since then, people significantly smarter than I am have written about, discussed, debated, agonised over them for decades. Yet many still feel they have no satisfactory answer. The contemporary art that posed these questions initially, and that which is derived from it, is largely mocked and derided as meaningless drivel- just look at any YouTube comments section on the subject. And whilst generally, I don't entirely disagree, there's one criticism of current art that I find baffling. 
"Pretentious".
In this essay, I will illustrate why I think that postmodern art is far more accessible to the general public than critics believe. Specifically, I will use the example of Viennese Actionism, which demonstrates common themes of postmodern art, but as postmodernism is a negatively defined reactionary art movement, I can't account for every aspect.
Viennese Actionism was an informal, avant-garde art movement that occurred in Austria from 1960 to 1971. It was made up primarily of four members, although there were others involved; Günter Brus, Rudolf Schwarzkogler, Hermann Nitsch and Otto Muehl, who partook in performances- referred to as “aktions”- which were short, violent, and occasionally illegal. Actionists often used organic materials in place of paint, such as blood, urine, faeces, and animal organs, and “painted” human bodies rather than canvases. They are considered some of the most extreme performances artists of the 20th century, if not of all time.
It is important to understand the environment from which Actionism was conceived to fully appreciate what the artists were doing. At the beginning of the 1960s, Vienna was still recovering from two world wars and Soviet occupation, which had lasted for ten years. There is little English documentation of conditions during this era, but when the Austrian government reformed in 1955, they were regarded by the artists as authoritative and controlling, a fascist state. Their art was intended to challenge conformity, conventional art, and the perceived perception of suppression of the trauma caused by World War II. The actionists themselves had all formally studied art at university, although not all completed their education, and only Muehl was old enough to have fought in the war. Actionism coincided with the “happenings” in New York and the international “Fluxus” movement.
The earliest Actionist pieces in the early 60s were untitled paintings by Günter Brus which feature wild black brushstrokes on a white canvas. Around this time, Brus developed more interest in the process of painting itself rather than the final product. Otto Muehl’s early works question the canvas, and pieces such as an untitled 1963 involve its desecration, and Hermann Nitsch had been involved in performance art since 1950, when he founded the “Theatre of Orgies and Mystery”. Rudolf Schwarzkogler is the only primary member who does not have any paintings documented, as most of his work was in photography and film.
In 1962, the first performative action Blutorgel Aktion (Blood Organ Action) was recorded as a collaboration between Nitsch and Muehl in Muehl’s basement over the span of three days. During the action the artists created splatter paintings using animal blood in lieu of paint and ultimately disembowelled and crucified a dead lamb upside down. Of course, the gratuitous violence and blasphemy inspired outrage amongst the conservative, Christian public, but this was only the beginning for the Actionists.
Gunter Brus’ performed his first public action, Wiener Spaziergang (Vienna Walk) in 1965 which is one of the most well-known and provocative Actionist performances, yet also easily the least horrifying. Intending to challenge an uninformed audience, Brus painted himself entirely in white paint with a black stripe down the middle and walked down a street. After only a few metres, police intervened and demanded he pay a fine. The piece is notable for how Brus’ arrest became inextricably interwoven with the performance itself, to the point where it is now considered part of its legacy- part of his intention, as he explicitly chose to 



 
[The bodily mutilation often present in the Actionists’ art could be seen as a reclamation of the pain they experienced and witnessed during the war.]
